app.use(): Adds middleware to the Express app.

cors():
origin: Specifies which origin is allowed to make requests (like http://localhost:3000).
credentials: true: Allows cookies and HTTP credentials to be sent in cross-origin requests.

This is important for security and enabling the frontend to talk to the backend when theyâ€™re on different domains or ports.
